== Installation ==

TaskJuggler III is written in [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby]. It
should run on any platform that Ruby is available on. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution, a package format called
[http://docs.rubygems.org RubyGems].

TaskJuggler III is still under development. There is no stable
version yet. You are welcome to try it. Some users are already using
it successfully for their purposes, but it might not yet be right for
you.

=== Requirements ===

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But TaskJuggler has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Please make sure you
have the minimum required version installed.

* '''Ruby:''' TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby.  You need a Ruby
runtime environment to run it. This can be downloaded from
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ here].  Most Linux
distributions usually have Ruby already included. So does MacOS X
Leopard. For Windows, there is a one-click installer available. The
recommended Ruby version to make full use of TaskJuggler is 1.9.2.
Ruby 1.9.1 contains some bugs that prevent the multi-core support to
work. For users that are not interested in multi-core support, the web
server,  the time sheet infrastructure and daemon Ruby 1.8.7 is still
ok to use.

* '''RubyGems:''' If it did not come with your OS or the Ruby
installation, see [http://docs.rubygems.org here] how to get and
install it.

=== Installation Steps for Users ===

==== The easy way ====

TaskJuggler is a commandline tool. It does not (yet) have a graphical
user interface. To use it, you need to know how to open a command
or terminal window. In this manual, we refer to it as your shell. The
following paragraphs describe the commands you need to type into your
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) shell].

On systems that already have Ruby and the gem package manager
installed you can simply type the following command into your shell
or command window:

  gem install taskjuggler

This will download and install the latest version from the
[http://rubygems.org/gems/taskjuggler RubyGems.org] site.

==== The manual way ====

If the easy way doesn't work for you, you need to download and install
the packages manually.  Download TaskJuggler III gem file from the
[http://rubygems.org/gems/taskjuggler RubyGems.org] site.

A gem package is an operating system and architecture independent
archive file for Ruby programs. You can install it on any system that
has Ruby and RubyGems installed.  Normally, you should be logged-in
as root or administrator to run the following installation command.
Replace the X.X.X with the actual version that you have downloaded.

 gem install pkg/taskjuggler-X.X.X.gem 

It will install all components of the Gem in the appropriate place.

On user friendly Linux distributions, the start scripts will be
installed in a standard directory like ''''/usr/bin''''. On Debian
based distributions, the start scripts end up in a place like
''''/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/'''' that is not listed in the ''''PATH''''
variable. You either have to create a symbolic link for each start
script or add the directory to your PATH variable. If you use the
standard [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash bash shell], put the
following line in your ''''${HOME}/.profile'''' file.

 PATH=${PATH}:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/

Windows and MacOS platforms may require similar steps.

=== Update from older TaskJuggler III versions ===

Updates work just like the installation.

 gem update taskjuggler

For downloaded or self-built packages use the following command:

 gem update pkg/taskjuggler-X.X.X.gem


=== Installation Steps for Developers ===

The following description is for users that want to learn more about
TaskJuggler or want to make improvements. TaskJuggler is
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] software and
you are encouraged to read and modify the source code.

To get the source code, the recommended way it to check out the
latest code from the developer repository. To do this, you need to
have [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/ git] installed.

Then checkout the source code with the following command

 git clone http://www.taskjuggler.org/git-repos/taskjuggler3.git

Make sure, you
have removed all previously installed instances of TaskJuggler from
your system before doing so. It is a common mistake to have an old
version of the TaskJuggler installed and then use parts of the old and
new version together.

If your Ruby installation does not come with the
[http://rake.rubyforge.org Rake] build tool, you need to install it
now.

If you are interested in a code coverage analysis, you need to also
install the [http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov rcov] code coverage
analysis tool. This tool is not needed for most developers. You can
safely ignore the warning during rake builds if you don't have it
installed.

The following command will create a gem package from the source code.

 cd taskjuggler3; rake gem
 
If you plan to modify the TaskJuggler files, creating and installing
the gem file for every test run is not very comfortable. To run tj3
from source put the following code in ''''${HOME}/bin/tj3''''. 

 #! /usr/bin/ruby
 
 # Set this to your source code directory
 ENV['TASKJUGGLER_DATA_PATH'] = "#{ENV['HOME']}/src/taskjuggler3"
 
 $:.unshift "#{ENV['TASKJUGGLER_DATA_PATH']}/lib/"
 
 require "taskjuggler3"

Don't forget to mark it as executable.

 chmod 750 ${HOME}/bin/tj3
