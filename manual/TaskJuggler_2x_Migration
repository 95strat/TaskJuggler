=== TaskJuggler 2.x Migration ===

This section will cover changes between TaskJuggler 2.x and 3.x.

* The ''''shift'''' attribute for tasks and resources has been
renamed to ''''shifts'''' to allow support for multiple shifts.

* The global ''''limits'''' attribute has been removed. Since both
tasks and resources have a ''''limits'''' attribute, a global
attribute was inconsistent as only resources inherited this
attribute. Use a parent resource to emulate the old behaviour.

* The ''''startbuffer'''' and ''''endbuffer'''' attributes have been
deprecated. They have not been widely used and had no impact on
scheduling.

* The ''''barlabels'''' attribute for reports is no longer needed.
HTML reports have always empty Gantt-chart bars and the calendar
reports always have values.

* The project attribute ''''allowredifinitions'''' has been dropped.
It was an ugly workaround for a rare corner case. Using [[supplement]] is
the clean way to do this.

* Camel case names for function names in logical expressions have
been deprecated. Function names need to be all lower case now.

* Top-level accounts no longer need a ''''cost'''' or ''''revenue''''
attribute. Any two top level accounts can now be balanced against
each other using the [[balance]] attribute in the report.

* The sorting modes have been extended to include the scenario. Also,
the sorting direction is no longer mangled with the attribute name.
What used to be ''''startup'''' is now ''''plan.start.up''''. See
[[sorttasks]] or [[sortresources]] for details.

* The attribute ''''properties'''' for ''''export'''' reports is no
longer supported. The naming was inconsistent with TaskJuggler lingo
and did not handle tasks and resources separately. It has been
replaced with [[taskattributes]] and [[resourceattributes]].

* Shifts and limits for allocations have been deprecated. The concept
was bogus and not compatible with bookings. The functionality is
now provided by [[shifts.task shifts]] and [[limits.task limits]] on the
task level. Limits for a task can be [[limit.resources selectively
applied]] to certain resources.

* Support for reading and writing XML files is no longer available.
The content was redundant with the TJP file format and it was not
widely used. Keeping it in sync was too much of an effort to be worth
it. There is nothing in the TJ3 design that would prevent this
feature from being added again, but there are no plans for this right
now.

* The format for [[report reports]] has been changed considerably.
The old format was not very flexible and had some design flaws.
TaskJuggler III now supports report nesting and composition. A report
definition can be used to generated multiple output [[formats]]. The
name of a report must now be specified without the file name
extension. It will be automatically added depending on the output
format.

* IDs for properties such as tasks, resources and reports are now
optional. If you don't need to reference a property, you can omit the
ID. TaskJuggler will automatically assign an ID then.
