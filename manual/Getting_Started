== Getting Started ==

=== Basics ===

TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project. The
main project should be placed in a file with the .tjp extension. This
main project may include other files. Such included files must have
file names with a ''''.tji'''' extension.

The graphical user interface from the 2.x version has not been ported
to TaskJuggler III yet. So all work with TaskJuggler needs to be done
in your favorite text editor and in a command shell.

The commandline version of TaskJuggler works like a compiler. You
provide the source files, it computes the contents and creates the
output files. Let's say you have a project file called AcSo.tjp. It
contains the tasks of your project and their dependencies. To schedule
the project and create report files you have to ask TaskJuggler to
process it.

TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the
htmltaskreport, htmlresourcereport or other report properties in the
input file.
