= Todo list for TaskJuggler III

This is a possibly still incomplete list of things that still could
or should be done for TaskJuggler III.

== Missing features for 2.x compatibility

* Add 'Account' property.

* Missing reports: htmlaccountreport, htmlstatusreport, htmlcalendar,
  xmlreport

* Critical path detection after scheduling.

* Most dynamic report columns are still missing.

* Legacy sorting modes.

* Function support for logical expressions.

== New features

* Hammock tasks

* Delta reports that show only the differences between 2 arbitrary
  scenarios.

= Discontinued 2.x features

TaskJuggler III should be mostly compatible with 2.x. Existing
projects should be usable with TaskJuggler III with no to minimal
effort. Nevertheless we will use the transition to TaskJuggler III as
an opportunity to drop some things that have been badly designed or
are of too little use to justify the porting efforts.

* XML file reading.
