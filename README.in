= Installation

TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] is written in Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org]. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution. The format is called {Ruby
Gems}[http://docs.rubygems.org]. Alternatively, you can install from a
tarball using setup.rb.

This is a prototype. Consider it being alpha quality at best!

== Requirements 

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Most Linux version
already have them included. Just have sure you have the minimum
required version.

[*Ruby*] TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] is written in Ruby.
	 You need a Ruby runtime environment to run it. This can be
	 downloaded from RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org]. Most Linux
	 distributions usually have Ruby already included.
	 TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] currently needs at
	 least version 1.8.4. Older version have been reported to show
	 frequent crashes due to what seems to be bugs in the
	 networking libraries.

[*RubyGems*] This is only needed when you don't want to use the
	     +setup.rb+ method. Most distros have RubyGems included,
	     so it's only listed for completeness. See
	     here[http://docs.rubygems.org] how to get and install it.

[*TaskJuggler*] Get it from the {Download Page}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/download.php]

== Installation Process

Just run as root

<tt>gem install taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem</tt> 

to install the gem file. It will install all components of the Gem in
the appropriate place.

See here[http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/setup/doc/usage.html] for
instructions on how to install the tarball. If you use a non-standard
prefix or datadir you need to add the path to AppConfig.rb. Otherwise
TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] will not be able to find the worldmap images.

== Update from previous versions

Updates work just like the installation.

<tt>gem update taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem</tt>
