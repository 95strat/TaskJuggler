== Installation ==

TaskJuggler III is written in [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby]. It
should run on any platform that Ruby is available on. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution. The package format is called
[http://docs.rubygems.org Ruby Gems]. Alternatively, you can install
from a the source code using ''''setup.rb''''.

This is a prototype. Consider it being alpha quality at best!

=== Requirements ===

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But TaskJuggler has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Please make sure you
have the minimum required version installed.

* ''Ruby'' TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby.  You need a Ruby
runtime environment to run it. This can be downloaded from
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ here].  Most Linux
distributions usually have Ruby already included. So does MacOS X
Leopard. For Windows, there is a one-click installer available.
TaskJuggler currently needs at least Ruby version 1.8.5.

* ''RubyGems'' If it did not come with your OS or Ruby package, see
[http://docs.rubygems.org here] how to get and install it.

* ''Rake'' [http://rake.rubyforge.org Rake] is only needed when you
start with the source code from the Git repository. It's not needed
when you already have a Gem package.

* ''TaskJuggler'' Get TaskJuggler III from the
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/download.php Download Page].

=== Installation Process ===

If you have checked-out the git repository, you need to build the Gem
package first.

 cd taskjuggler3; ./makedist

To install the Gem package, just run as root the following command.

 gem install pkg/taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem 

It will install all components of the Gem in the appropriate place.

=== Update from previous versions ===

Updates work just like the installation.

 gem update pkg/taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem
