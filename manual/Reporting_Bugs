=== Reporting Bugs and Sending Feedback ===

All official releases of TaskJuggler are meant to be stable releases
unless explicitly noted differently. But our test suite is still very
small and some features are not tested at all. So it's very likely
that your current version of TaskJuggler contains some bugs. If you
find a bug, please follow this procedure:

* Read this manual to make sure that it is actually a bug and not a
feature.

* Check the [http://www.taskjuggler.org TaskJuggler web page] and the
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2 Discussion Forum].

* Possibly the bug was already found
and a patch or workaround exists.

* Try to create a test project that is as small as possible but still
reproduces the bug.

* Send the test project and a detailed description of the problem to
the [http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2 TaskJuggler Developer
Forum].  Not sending a test project is the most common mistake when
reporting bugs. This usually triggers requests or leads to bug reports
being ignored.
