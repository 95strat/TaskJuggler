= About TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org]

TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] is an Open Source project
management software. This Ruby implementation is a prototype for what
could be the next generation of TaskJuggler. If you are looking for a
stable software to manage your projects, use the 2.x series releases.

= Installation

TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org]. It
should run on any platform that Ruby is available on. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution. The format is called {Ruby
Gems}[http://docs.rubygems.org]. Alternatively, you can install from a
tarball using setup.rb.

This is a prototype. Consider it being alpha quality at best!

== Requirements 

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But TaskJuggler has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Most Linux version
already have them included. Just have sure you have the minimum
required version.

[*Ruby*] TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby.  You need a Ruby runtime
environment to run it. This can be downloaded from
here[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/].  Most Linux
distributions usually have Ruby already included.
TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] currently needs at least
version 1.8.5.

[*RubyGems*] Most distros have RubyGems included, so it's only listed
for completeness. See here[http://docs.rubygems.org] how to get and
install it.

[*TaskJuggler*] Get TaskJuggler III from the {Download Page}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/download.php]

== Installation Process

If you have checked-out the git repository, you need to build the Gem
package first.

<tt>cd taskjuggler3; ./makedist</tt>

To install the Gem package, just run as root the following command.

<tt>gem install taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem</tt> 

It will install all components of the Gem in the appropriate place.

== Update from previous versions

Updates work just like the installation.

<tt>gem update taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem</tt>

= Using TaskJuggler III

There is currently no consistent user manual available. But you can
get along pretty well by using the {TaskJuggler 2.x
manual}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/manual-git/index.html] and the
TaskJuggler III {syntax
reference}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/refman/index.html].
