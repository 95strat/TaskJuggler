=== About TaskJuggler ===

TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful project management tool. Its new
approach to project planning and tracking is far superior to the
commonly used Gantt chart editing tools. It has already been
successfully used in many projects and scales easily to projects with
hundreds of resources and thousands of tasks.

TaskJuggler is an Open Source tool for serious project managers. It
covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the
first idea to the completion of the project. It assists you during
project scoping, resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk
and communication management.

TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your
project time lines and resource assignments based on the project
outline and the constrains that you have provided. The built-in
resource balancer and consistency checker offload you from having to
worry about irrelevant details and ring the alarm if the project gets
out of hand. Its flexible "as many details as necessary"-approach
allows you to still plan your project as you go, making it also ideal
for new management strategies such as Extreme Programming and Agile
Project Management.

If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together
your colleague's shift plan for the next month, TaskJuggler is the
right tool for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt
charts to impress your boss or your investors, TaskJuggler might not
be right for you. It takes some effort to master its power, but it
will become a companion you don't want to miss anymore.
