# The TextParser implements a regular LALR parser. But it uses a recursive
# rule traversor instead of the more commonly found state machine generated by
# yacc-like tools. Since stack depths is not really an issue with a Ruby
# implementation this approach has one big advantage. The parser can be
# modified during parsing. This allows support for languages that can extend
# themself. The TaskJuggler syntax is such an beast. Traditional yacc
# generated parsers would fail with such a syntax.
#
# This class is just a base class. A complete parser would derive from this
# class and implement the rule set and the functions _nextToken()_ and
# _returnToken()_. It also needs to set the array _variables_ to declare all
# variables ($SOMENAME) that the scanner may deliver.
#
# To describe the syntax the functions TextParser#newRule,
# TextParser#newPattern, TextParser#optional and
# TextParser#repeatable can be used. When the rule set is changed during
# parsing, TextParser#updateParserTables must be called to make the changes
# effective.
#
# To start parsing the input the function TextParser#parse needs to be called
# with the name of the start rule.
