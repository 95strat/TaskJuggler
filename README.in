= About {TaskJuggler III}[http://www.taskjuggler.org]

TaskJuggler III is an Open Source project management software. Right
now it is just a prototype of what will become the next generation of
TaskJuggler. If you are looking for a stable software to manage your
projects, use the 2.x series releases.

In contrast to the 2.x version TaskJuggler III should be easily
installable and usable on non Unix/Linux systems as well. If you
don't fear the command prompt and can handle a text editor you can
even use it on Windows and MacOS X.

= Installation

TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org]. It
should run on any platform that Ruby is available on. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution. The package format is called {Ruby
Gems}[http://docs.rubygems.org]. Alternatively, you can install from a
the source code using setup.rb.

This is a prototype. Consider it being alpha quality at best!

== Requirements 

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But TaskJuggler has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Please make sure you
have the minimum required version installed.

[*Ruby*] TaskJuggler III is written in Ruby.  You need a Ruby runtime
	 environment to run it. This can be downloaded from
	 here[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/].  Most Linux
	 distributions usually have Ruby already included. So does
	 MacOS X Leopard. For Windows, there is a one-click installer
	 available.  TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] currently
	 needs at least Ruby version 1.8.5.

[*RubyGems*] If it did not come with your OS or Ruby package, see
	     here[http://docs.rubygems.org] how to get and install it.

[*Rake*] Rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org] is only needed when you
	 start with the source code from the Git repository. It's not
	 needed when you already have a Gem package.

[*TaskJuggler*] Get TaskJuggler III from the
                {Download Page}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/download.php]

== Installation Process

If you have checked-out the git repository, you need to build the Gem
package first.

<tt>cd taskjuggler3; ./makedist</tt>

To install the Gem package, just run as root the following command.

<tt>gem install pkg/taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem</tt> 

It will install all components of the Gem in the appropriate place.

== Update from previous versions

Updates work just like the installation.

<tt>gem update pkg/taskjuggler3-X.X.X.gem</tt>

= Using TaskJuggler III

There is currently no consistent user manual available. But you can
get along pretty well by using the {TaskJuggler 2.x
manual}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/manual-git/index.html] and the
TaskJuggler III {syntax
reference}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/refman/index.html].

= Bugs reports, sending patches and other feedback

This Ruby implementation of TaskJuggler[http://www.taskjuggler.org] is
just a prototype. Feedback is welcome, but don't expect any kind of
support. Certain feature are still missing or don't work properly
yet.! Please post a message on the {TaskJuggler
Forum}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2/] to get in contact with
the developers or other users. Don't forget to upload a small sample
project to illustrate the problem you are reporting.

For legal reasons, we want to track the authors of all contributions.
Therefore we only accept patches in
Git[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/] format. Patches
should only be made against the latest development version. The
TaskJuggler 2.x manual has a good description on {how to contribute
patches}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/manual-git/how_to_contribute.html].
