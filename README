= About {TaskJuggler III}[http://www.taskjuggler.org]

TaskJuggler III is a modern and powerful, Free and Open Source Software project
management tool. Its new approach to project planing and tracking is more
flexible and superior to the commonly used Gantt chart editing tools.

TaskJuggler III is project management software for serious project managers. It
covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the first idea
to the completion of the project. It assists you during project scoping,
resource assignment, cost and revenue planing, risk and communication
management.

TaskJuggler III provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your project time
lines and resource assignments based on the project outline and the
constraints that you have provided. The built-in resource balancer and
consistency checker offload you from having to worry about irrelevant details
and ring the alarm if the project gets out of hand. The flexible
as-many-details-as-necessary approach allows you to plan your project as you
go, making it also ideal for new management strategies such as Extreme
Programming and Agile Project Management.

If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together the
release schedule of your open source project, TaskJuggler III is the right
tool for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt charts to impress
your boss or your investors, TaskJuggler III might not be right for you. You
can of course create nice looking Gantt charts. But it takes a little more
effort to master its power. If you are up for this, TaskJuggler III will
become a companion that you don't want to miss anymore.

TaskJuggler III is written in {Ruby}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/] and should
be easily installable and usable on all popular operating systems. It may
sound surprising at first, but this software does not need a graphical user
interface. A command shell, a plain text editor (no word processor!) and a web
browser is all you need for your work.

TaskJuggler III has not yet been released as a stable version. The primary
reason is that we don't want to freeze the syntax before it has been used by a
larger audience. By now, changes should be small, but we cannot yet rule out
minor compatibility issues when upgrading to a newer version. We also have a
fairly small test suite. It's quite possible, that you will run into a bug or
two. Please report it into our {issue
tracker}[https://github.com/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler/issues].
