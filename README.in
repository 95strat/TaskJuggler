= About TaskJuggler

TaskJuggler is an Open Source project management software. This Ruby
implementation is a prototype for what could be the next generation
of TaskJuggler. If you are looking for a stable software to manage
your projects, use the 2.x series releases.


= Installation

TaskJuggler is written in Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org]. It uses the
standard Ruby mechanism for distribution. The format is called {Ruby
Gems}[http://docs.rubygems.org]. Alternatively, you can install from a
tarball using setup.rb.

This is a prototype. Consider it being alpha quality at best!

== Requirements 

Ruby applications are platform independent. There is no need to
compile anything. But ClickSpotter has a very small set of
dependencies that you have to take care of first. Most Linux version
already have them included. Just have sure you have the minimum
required version.

[*Ruby*] ClickSpotter is written in Ruby. You need a Ruby runtime
         environment to run it. This can be downloaded from
         RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org]. Most Linux distributions usually have
         Ruby already included. ClickSpotter currently needs at least version
         1.8.4. Older version have been reported to show frequent crashes due
         to what seems to be bugs in the networking libraries.

[*RubyGems*] This is only needed when you don't want to use the
             +setup.rb+ method. Most distros have RubyGems included,
	     so it's only listed for completeness. See
	     here[http://docs.rubygems.org] how to get and install it.

#[*Qt*] ClickSpotter uses the Qt Toolkit from
#       Trolltech[http://www.trolltech.com]. This toolkit was choosen because
#       it matches the elegance and beauty of Ruby. Almost every Linux
#       distribution has a recent version of Qt included.
#
#[*qtruby*] To use Qt with Ruby, you also need the qtruby bindings. This is the
#           magic glue that let's Ruby interact with Qt. See {the page on
#           RubyForge}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum] for details. You
#	   need at least version 1.0.11. Then you need to manually add
#	   {this small
#	   patch}[http://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/3.5/kdebindings/qtruby/rubylib/qtruby/lib/Qt/qtruby.rb?rev=496301&r1=486770&r2=496301]
#	   to <tt>rubylib/qtruby/lib/Qt/qtruby.rb</tt> adding
#	   <tt>uchar|</tt> to line 583.

Page}[http://www.taskjuggler.org/download.php]

== Installation Process

Just run as root

<tt>gem install TaskJuggler-X.X.X.gem</tt> 

to install the gem file. It will install all components of the Gem in
the appropriate place.

See here[http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/setup/doc/usage.html] for
instructions on how to install the tarball. If you use a non-standard
prefix or datadir you need to add the path to AppConfig.rb. Otherwise
ClickSpotter will not be able to find the worldmap images.

== Update from previous versions

Updates work just like the installation.

<tt>gem update TaskJuggler-X.X.X.gem</tt>


= Bugs reports and other feedback

This Ruby implementation of TaskJuggler is just a prototype. Feedback
is welcome, but don't expect any kind of support. It is not meant to
work!
