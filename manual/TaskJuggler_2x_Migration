=== TaskJuggler 2.x Migration ===

This section will cover changes between TaskJuggler 2.x and 3.x.

* The ''''shift'''' attribute for tasks and resources has been
renamed to ''''shifts'''' to allow support for multiple shifts.

* The global ''''limits'''' attribute has been removed. Since both
tasks and resources have a ''''limits'''' attribute, a global
attribute was inconsistent as only resources inherited this
attribute. Use a parent resource to emulate the old behaviour.

* The ''''startbuffer'''' and ''''endbuffer'''' attributes have been
deprecated. They have not been widely used and had no impact on
scheduling.

* The ''''barlabels'''' attribute for reports is no longer needed.
HTML reports have always empty Gantt-chart bars and the calendar
reports always have values.

* The project attribute ''''allowredifinitions'''' has been dropped.
It was an ugly workaround for a rare corner case. Using [[supplement]] is
the clean way to do this.

* Camel case names for function names in logical expressions have
been deprecated. Function names need to be all lower case now.

* Top-level accounts no longer need a ''''cost'''' or ''''revenue''''
attribute. Any two top level accounts can now be balanced against
each other using the [[balance]] attribute in the report.

* The sorting modes have been extended to include the scenario. Also,
the sorting direction is no longer mangled with the attribute name.
What used to be ''''startup'''' is now ''''plan.start.up''''. See
[[sorttasks]] or [[sortresources]] for details.

* The attribute ''''properties'''' for ''''export'''' reports is no
longer supported. The naming was inconsistent with TaskJuggler lingo
and did not handle tasks and resources separately. It has been
replaced with [[taskattributes]] and [[resourceattributes]].
